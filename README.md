**Brief Description**

Recreate in Java the 1979 Atari game 'Asteroids'.  See https://freeasteroids.org/ for further game details and or game play. Our recreation project(of the original 1979 game) has one required difference and the remaining feature requirements and their implementation may not be the same.

#Differences#

The following are 1979 game features that had different implementation requirements:

 - The Original Game thrust feature only provided movement and died out shortly after the release of the thrust feature button. Our recreation requires an equal application of the thrust feature button in the direct opposite direction to bring it to a stop.

  - 

#Features not required for this Assignment#

The following are 1979 game features that were not implementation requirements:

 - Each new player ship life, to start, may either be placed in a currently safe location (or be invincible for a brief period).
 
  - The Alien ship behavior or methods do not need to be the same (get smaller and or faster) as the 1979 game with each higher difficulty level. 

   - The point system is not required to be the same as the 1979 game. 

**New Features implementation Descriptions**

#Alien Boss?#

Bigger Badder ship?


#Aliens ala asteroids#

Higher levels get Aliens that split and have three levels to themselves?

#Player ship Ramrod#

After so many points, for a limited time (Ramrod?) to pierce through space objects?

#Player ship multiple type bullets#

After so many points, a limited time bullets are fired in threes (either in succcession or in spray pattern)?
